This week has been a relatively good week. Although i still feel like i have less understanding than the average student in the class, i feel like i have been slowly and steadily learning. It has been helpful to receive extra support and tips from Katrina and from my SalesEngine partner, Geoff. 

The SalesEngine project somehow seems less intimidating than the previous projects - probably because i've had a partner who has been able to patiently explain things when i've been confused but also because the coding is not much more advanced than it was for the last project. This has allowed my programming knowledge a chance to improve without feeling like there are many new concepts that need to be learned and incorporated. I feel like i have been able to understand the big-picture layout of the projects - like which classes to create and how to get design the project in a way that allows each of the classes/objects to access and reference each other. However, i get tripped up when it comes to implementing those ideas. I can understand the idea but i still feel inept at writing the code that makes the idea actually work. Though i do feel a little more capable of that this week than last week.

Minitesting is still pretty confusing for me. I understand the concept of writing a test, then writing code to fulfill the test... but i often don't understand how to write a good test or how to write the appropriate code to make it pass or fail.

I have enjoyed working in pairs this week, although i don't feel like i have been able to contribute enough. I think i would be much further behind if i was working alone and i feel like my lack of understanding has been holding up my partner. 

I definitely don't feel like a developer yet. lol. In fact, i don't even feel like i can hold a knowledgeable conversation with a developer. I feel like i am still trying to grasp the basics. However, i am still optimistic about how much i can learn during the rest of the program. I feel like once the basics - the syntax and "rules" of Ruby - set in, then my understanding will develop very fast. I may not be able to achieve a level of understanding equal to some of my colleagues but i look forward to having a strong working knowledge of Ruby and programming.
