This week was especially rough. The last few weeks have been a challenge because i have not been learning Rails as quickly as i expected. I thought that things would start to fall into place this week but it feels like i made very little progress.

We spent the last week working on Son of Store Engine. I feel like i really let my team down because there was so little that i could contribute to the project. I found myself avoiding my teammates because i didn't want to face the perpetual question of "what have you done today (or yesterday)." On my own, i feel like i made a little progress in my understanding of Rails but it was slow and far removed from the level of understanding required to work on this project. I feel like i am getting further behind the class every week. It sucks.

On the last day of the project, i was able to contribute by learning about the gem Faker and using it to populate our database. It took me the entire day, which feels like way too much time, but it was still satisfying to make a contribution and gain some proficiency with a small part of the project's code. It made me think that i may be trying to do too much each day and that it may be better to focus on one small section of code (a gem, a model, etc.) per day to gain a good understanding of it instead of jumping from one thing to another. Learning one thing at a day feels much slower - and it definitely doesn't allow me enough time to learn all the things that i need to learn - but it feels like a better process, at my current stage. By learning one thing at a time, i am able to slowly build blocks of understanding upon each other and gain a stable working knowledge of Rails. So i think i will try to focus on this process more in the next couple weeks.

I've already started this one-thing-at-a-time process over the last day or two. When i had some time to study yesterday and today, i decided to focus on adding css styling to my Rails side-project (building a website for my soccer team). As with most exercises, this has taken much longer than expected to do something relatively simple. But i am learning as i go and it feels like i am "getting somewhere" by seeing the exercise through to completion. So, hopefully, this new approach will lead to more learning momentum.
