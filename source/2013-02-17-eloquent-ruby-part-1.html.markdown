Part One of Eloquent Ruby is about the basic concepts and logic that make up the Ruby programming language. It is essentially an easy-to-read owner's manual for anyone learning Ruby. It is a more readable and more practical alternative to the Pickaxe book, the Ruby bible. The author, Russ Olsen, serves as a tour guide who takes the reader on a path through the jungle of Ruby syntax and concepts. Along the way, he offers quick and instructive demonstrations of how to implement Ruby's tools while indicating some of the more exotic and unique features that make this language so popular. 

The book is laid out in a very logical way that offers entry points for readers of any skill level. For beginners, it is best to start at page one and develop a strong foundation of understanding. More advanced programmers could jump to a specific chapter in Part Two or Three. The natural structure of Eloquent Ruby also allows it to be used by expert programmers as a kind of quick-reference book to find descriptions of seldom used techniques. 

For me, this book was a welcome return to the building blocks of programming after three weeks of treading water in a sea of techniques that only partially make sense. I loved the progression of starting from the ground up and building a knowledge base that could then support some of the more advanced tools and ideas. Several of the ideas presented in Part One have helped fill in gaps in my understanding and i wish i had read them sooner. I feel like this book would have been a more natural first read for our course and, in retrospect, its curious that we started with a book that was primarily about career development instead of a book about the skill of programming. Although i would have preferred to read Eloquent Ruby earlier, nonetheless, i am happy to be reading it now.
