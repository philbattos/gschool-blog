This has been a good week in terms of my learning and understanding of Ruby. It finally feels like some of the concepts and syntax of programming are starting to 'click'. I spent the week working in the "emerging" group with Katrina and i found it really beneficial. We worked on some basic exercises (mostly warmups) and repeated them over and over which helped us develop a solid understanding of TDD and building simple programs. I found the repetition to be really helpful. It was sometimes hard to delete a bunch of code that i had been working on for hours and start over again but it helped to instill the value of treating code as "cheap" and always capable of being recreated. It gave me more confidence to write code experimentally and then toss it out if it doesn't work instead of sticking to one approach and trying to make it work.

This week i also learned a little more about the flow of writing tests, writing code, refactoring, then writing more code. This is one of those intangible, feel-based parts of programming that just develops with time. I still don't feel like i know exactly when is the right time to refactor code before moving on to the next test or feature but i have a much better sense of it than i did last week.

Being in a group with people who were all around my level of understanding was also a positive experience because it allowed us to bond and support each other in a way that wasn't possible when we were paired with more advanced students. It was encouraging to know that we were all struggling with the same basic problems. I also liked that we were given the time to work through the problems on our own (or in a pair) rather than being forced by the constraints of a deadline to move on without fully understanding how.

I feel like i would really benefit from more exercises and more tutoring like we received this week. However, i also want to continue working on projects with the rest of the class so that we are all learning together. So, i look forward to what the next weeks have in store for us.
