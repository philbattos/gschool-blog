This week was a pretty good week for me. We finished up Daughter of Store Engine (DOSE). We had a great team and our completion process was relatively smooth and easy.

I really liked the way this project was structured. By having multiple meetings with the "client" throughout the project - and only receiving instructions for the next iteration of the process - it felt like the pace and workflow of our work was more manageable than in previous projects. By only focusing on the next task (instead of something a week or two ahead), it felt like the whole team was engaged and on top of the project for the entire time.

I also like the focus of our tasks: CSS. Over the last couple weeks, i have been wanting to practice more CSS so i was happy to have the opportunity to do that in this project. I think it was the right kind of project for me because i was able to understand what we were doing most of the time and i was able to make some worthwhile contributions. I spent a lot of time trying to figure out some small problems but, for the most part, i think they led to a valuable learning experience.

I'm looking forward to practicing some of the things i've learned over the last few weeks by creating my own sample store. It will be very basic to start with but i think it will be a great practice exercise for developing my skills with TDD, git workflow, heroku deployment, project management with Tracker stories, and overall Rails familiarity.

As we start to look forward to what happens after the course, i am both excited and disappointed. I feel like i am just starting to understand Ruby and Rails and i feel like i need much more time to study and practice it. So it feels like i'm not ready to leave the school environment. On the other hand, i am really looking forward to putting my knowledge and skills into practice in a real world setting. So, i don't want the course to end - and i'm looking forward to the next chapter.
