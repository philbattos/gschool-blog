In the last week, i had some moments of feeling like i was making progress in understanding Rails but the last few days i have again been feeling lost and disappointed with my development. I have been working on a small Rails project on the side (with help from Katrina) and i feel like there have been a number of small "wins". At times, i have had to rely on the blogger tutorial but i have learned a lot just by trying to figure things out myself. However, in class and project times, i feel like i have not been able to learn or contribute anything worthwhile.

We started our new project this week, Son of Store Engine. We were all put in teams of four - except my group, Mr Blue, which has Josh, Elaine, and myself. I really like our team. I feel like we get along really well and there are no personality conflicts. However, the project requires a lot of work in a short amount of time and with a smaller group there is additional pressure on each of us to contribute. And yet i feel like there are very few stories that i can work on. I am still having trouble understanding the details of the code in the Rails projects. I have tried reaching out for help from my team but with a smaller group and a tight deadline i feel like my questions slow down the group and hinder progress. It has also been hard this week finding enough time to work on the project and study up on Rails because i had to prepare a lightning talk.

Jeff and i have tried contacting my mentor, Arjun Sharma, without much success. Lew has been in touch with him but Lew hasn't responded to my tweets or chats so i still haven't had any direct contact with Arjun. I think Lew is at Galvanize today so i hope to talk with him about and figure out how to reach Arjun.
