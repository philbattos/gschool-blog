SalesEngine

The SalesEngine project was a large project which was intimidating at first but turned out to be relatively simple and straightforward. It did not feel like a big leap in programming skill-level from EventReporter; rather, the increased complexity was a result of more files to integrate and more repetitive actions to perform on the data.

I think the main lessons from this project were how to work efficiently in pairs and how to do all of the work (coding, git pushing, merging, testing, etc.) methodically so that time was not wasted on unnecessary problems (merge conflicts, gem formatting, etc.). The programming challenges were manageable but doing them with a partner introduced another dimension to the experience. Sometimes this made the work easier (by sharing responsibilities) and sometimes it made the work harder (because we had to coordinate our understanding or find a common style of working) but it always gave us another thing to consider. I went into this project expecting that it would be relatively easy to adjust to working with a partner but now i feel like it takes time and experience to find a "groove" with any partner. And the experience reminded me of the importance of clear communication.

The other lesson that i took away from this project was the importance of working methodically and making sure all the details are taken care of. It is easy when working with a deadline to get consumed by the desire to just get code written quickly - and then fix it later if necessary - or to just run with the first idea without taking the time to check the details and consider alternatives. But this approach will almost always incur time delays in the latter stages of the project. It is much better to take each task slowly and work through it step-by-step. Especially when working on a large project that contains many separate but related parts, time invested up front will result in a much smoother process. Although my partner and i did a good job of following this advice, i saw the difficulties that other teams faced when they didn't have a methodical process. And it made me thankful of how smooth our project went.

I feel like i put a lot of hours into our SalesEngine project but not as many as my partner did and i feel like most of my hours weren't valuable. I did my best to remain an active member and contributor to our team but, honestly, my partner, Geoff, was responsible for most of the actual coding. If i were to do this project over again, i think i would identify some areas in which i could make a clear contribution and spend more time on those.
