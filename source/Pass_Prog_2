The Passionate Programmer is essentially a career counseling book directed at computer programmers. It is a compilation of lessons learned by the author, Chad Fowler, while he developed a career as a programmer. The inspiration of the book came as he saw many of the jobs in his field outsourced to places like India, which led him to adopting a more proactive, business-savvy approach to programming. 

One of the central themes in the book is that the reader, as a current or future programmer, has a great deal of autonomy and freedom in deciding what his/her career looks like. Fowler embraces some of the ideas championed by people like Tim Ferriss that are revolutionizing the traditional employee-employer paradigm. Rather than treating programmers as "employees" working to fulfill the corporate demands of their bosses, he views each programmer as an individual micro-business that must develop proficiency in many non-programming areas (marketing, interpersonal skills, evaluating competition, surveying the market, investigating cutting edge technologies, investing in new skills, etc.) in order to achieve success. For Fowler, a good programmer is not simply good at programming but good at all the business skills (and life skills) that distinguish him/her as an extraordinary business partner. 

As someone who is relatively new to the field of programming, i drew a lot of encouragement from his advice. Although i may not be the most proficient coder in our class, i feel like i have a lot of real-world skills and experience to offer software development shops. I think this will become a valuable asset when we are interviewing companies for jobs. Beyond a basic level of competence, success in business is much more about creating a vibrant culture and developing healthy working relationships with your colleagues. I am looking forward to finding a company with a culture of innovation and that recognizes the value of the whole person.
