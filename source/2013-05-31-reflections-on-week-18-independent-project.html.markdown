This has been a good week. I really like the project that i selected. I am making a site that allows users to search for clues (keywords) in the Fenn treasure hunt. The search finds geographic place names associated with the clues and then maps them using Google Maps. With more time, it could be a very useful tool for treasure hunting as well as collecting data about what clues people are researching and where they are looking. I think i chose a project that provides the right scope for my current understanding and is something that i can continue to develop and learn from. I am excited about creating something that really works and it feels like it is right at my level.

I created four iterations, knowing that i will probably only be able to finish the first one or two. I like that it is an easily scalable project. The first couple iterations are relatively small and manageable for a two-week project but they also will produce a valuable and highly-functional site. Iterations three and four are sizable enhancements but still offer a specific focus of features (so that the implementation will not be too broad). Each iteration offers a specific feature but does not require too much work. After completing the first four iterations that i have identified so far, i will have a useful site that will, hopefully, support further development. After this project is finished, i would like to keep working on this site until it is ready to be used by other treasure hunters - and then possibly release it and see if people like using it.

I feel really good about my organization and workflow so far. I have spent a fair amount of time slowly working through problems on my own but i feel like i have been learning along the way. And it is so satisfying to finally figure out a problem that has kept me stuck. Sometimes i do wish i had someone to bounce questions off of but solving problems on my own feels like good practice for when i don't have so much support around me.
