This week was a pretty good week for me, although i still feel like i haven't learned too much. I really appreciated the change of pace with this project. For my team, at least, we feel like the project is relatively easy and allows us some time to focus more on developing good quality code instead of just satisfying the base expectations. Personally, i feel like an "easier" project allows more time to work with my teammates, ask more questions, and stumble through my tasks without feeling as much pressure to get everything done quickly.

I also like that our project is mainly focused on css improvements. I spent some time last week digging into css and i still feel like i don't understand it very well, so i am happy to have a project where we can learn it better. Despite the slower pace and shifted focus of the project, i still feel like i am having a hard time learning things. Several times in the last couple weeks, i have felt like i don't learn as well and as quickly as most of my classmates, and it is really frustrating.

I definitely prefer the agile process that we have been using instead of a waterfall approach. Small, short iterations are much more manageable than large tasks that take several days. I especially like having more frequent contact with the "client" to get regular feedback and move through the project one step at a time.
