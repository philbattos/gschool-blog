This week was another good week. I feel like my understanding of Ruby syntax continues to solidify and get stronger almost every day. I don't really feel like i've learned many new concepts or techniques but the basics that i've been struggling with for the last couple months are finally becoming established in my mind. It feels like i have developed a strong foundation over the last couple weeks that will enable me to move on to learning other things - like Rails.

The group i was in last week (the "remedial" group) was reassessed this week to see how far we've progressed. I was happy to see some clear progress and still a little disappointed in how much i still don't know. The assessment exercise (a modified version of the Scrabble exercise) was quite challenging. I feel like i did well on it considering where my understanding is at but i also feel like i should be able to complete the whole thing by this point in the course. I have continued to work on it since the assessment and have almost completed it. It seems like a great exercise for learning Ruby because there are several parts and many ways to approach most of those parts. So i think i will continue to work on that exercise for the next few weeks to come up with new solutions and learn some new techniques.

This week we have also been introduced to Rails. With the reassessment and devoting time to practicing Ruby syntax, i have not been able to spend as much time on learning Rails as i would have liked. However, working through the Blogger exercise has made me feel encouraged about how long it will take to learn Rails. It feels like it will be a lot easier to become proficient with Rails than it was with Ruby. Although i feel slightly behind the class in terms of our progress through Rails, it does not feel like i will be lagging for long. So i am looking forward to gaining more experience with Rails over the next week and hopefully catching up to the rest of the class in the next few weeks.

Based on my very limited experience with Rails so far, i like it a lot more than Sinatra. However, during the TrafficSpy project, i feel like i missed some valuable information on how Sinatra and databases work and i would like to go back and re-learn those things at some point. I feel like there is this constant tension while we are working on projects: i would prefer to gain a clear understanding of how something (Ruby, databases, git, etc.) works before trying to use it in a project; yet, i also want to keep up with the rest of the class and work on projects that everyone is working on. I guess i would prefer that the pace of the class were a little slower so that the knowledge and understanding would sink in more before being asked to apply it.
