For the last week we have been working on our first Rails project. I was optimistic last week about my ability to understand Rails and make some valuable contributions to my team but i have been feeling a little more discouraged during the last few days. I felt really comfortable with the Rails tutorial, blogger. I had a good, although basic, understanding of how the components of a Rails project and how they communicate with each other. However, when it came time to create our own project and write code that created specific results, it got a lot harder. I can generally follow the relationships between the router, models, and views and i can understand the objective that we want to achieve. But i get stuck when it comes down to making it happen. The actual code is still a little confusing to me.

So, i guess i would say that Rails takes a complex and confusing system and streamlines it so that we, as programmers, can focus on the most vital parts. I feel like the hardest part of Rails is understanding the many layers of relationship and functionality between all the different parts. I think building a web app would be incredibly more difficult without Rails. With Rails, it is manageable for a beginner.

The biggest challenge for me in this project, as in previous projects, is that i feel like i haven't been able to make significant contributions. I just don't understand the code well enough to write feature so i feel like i am relegated to working on things like team workflow, website design, and user experience, which are generally not my strong suits. I like the concept of focused pairing but, unfortunately, working closely with someone else just highlights how little i know and leaves me feeling incapable. It also places more of a burden on my partner to lead me/us through the swamp of confusion so that we can accomplish something during our session. I would love to use that time to ask questions and develop my understanding of Rails but this is hard because it feels like robbing my pairing partner of his/her opportunity to properly practice pairing.

Right now, i feel like our completed project will be somewhere between 'crap' and 'decent'. I want to make it better but i feel like i don't have the skills so i am relying on my teammates to do most of the heavy lifting.
