The Passionate Programmer is a book that is full of good advice - advice that can be applied to one's personal life as well as to programming. It reads kind of like a cross between a programmer's version of Chicken Soup for the Soul and The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People. The author's advice is directed at software developers but there is no attempt to teach the reader how to become better at coding. Instead, the book offers advice on business, career development, and general life skills that will lead to a fulfilling life as a programmer. The author is not so interested in cultivating better programmers but, rather, helping programmers cultivate a more rewarding life and career. 

Fowler shares many valuable life lessons that he has learned through "failing and copying." I espcially liked tips 4 and 29, "Be the Worst" and "Learn How to Fail," respectively, because they show how the seeds of success and accomplishment are present even in our experiences of failure and ineptitude. They remind us that success and failure are not complete opposites but are interwoven with each other, a theme that the author returns to again and again. There is so much to be learned from failure and inexperience if we just change our perspective a little. I think i am also drawn to these tips at the moment because i feel like i am one of the least experienced students in the class and i will be doing a lot of failing for the first few weeks. So it is reassuring to be reminded of the benefits of being in that position.

One of the things that i appreciate most about the Passionate Programmer is the way that the author highlights the interdependence of the tips. He advises us to "Be a Generalist" and to "Be a Specialist." because we need to be adaptable and maintain a broad understanding of our business but we also need to develop a deep understanding of a few specific things. He says we should "Find a Mentor" and that we should "Be a Mentor" because teaching is the best way to learn. This kind of yin-yang presentation of the tips expresses a great deal of wisdom and, in my eyes, lends credibility to his advice. He is not offering a black & white, one size fits all paradigm. Rather, he is showing us a nuanced, interconnected perspective that includes the "good" and "bad" parts of life. Life itself is complex and interdependent and, by fully embracing it, Fowler is suggesting that we will find a richer and more rewarding life.
