This has been a good week. I have been able to make some contributions to my team's project; i've learned several things about css; and i enjoyed spending the day in Boulder for Startup Week.

<strong>FeedEngine</strong>

The best thing about FeedEngine is that it is not another StoreEngine project; the worst thing is that it is still an "engine" project. I like the focused-learning of this project. It does not have too many new things to learn but the major learning piece (APIs) is quite complex. I like our team but i feel like we slacked a little during the first week so we may have to work a lot over the next week to get everything finished. I think our finished product will be quite good - almost good enough to distribute as a working app.

Boulder Startup Week

I was looking for an opportunity to attend some of the events of Boulder Startup Week but it was hard to find the time. So i was very happy when Jeff invited the class to spend the day in Boulder. It was probably the best day of class for me. It felt like a great luxury to be able to sleep in a little and then walk down to meet everyone. We were able to visit several dev shops and startups in town and it was great to get a taste for the different companies in town. I especially liked QuickLeft and Gnip.

Being at the companies and talking to the people who work there gave me a better sense of what to expect after gSchool. I feel like i am still a long ways from being a qualified "developer" but my experience yesterday did make me feel like that title is more in reach.
