The Event Reporter project was a humbling and challenging endeavor for me. From a programming perspective, the tasks were hard and, when combined with being sick and not being able to find adequate help, i floundered at even putting together some working code. 

I put in sufficient hours to complete the project - probably 11-12 hours a day but at least half of that time was spent studying and practicing coding concepts that were more fundamental than the ones that we were meant to be implementing. In short, i felt like i was trying to do catch-up work while simultaneously trying to complete the project. I worked alone for most of the week, which was partly due to my being sick, partly due to my lack of understanding of some of the basic coding concepts that my colleagues were using, and partly due to my desire to study some of the more basic ideas. I would have liked to have worked more closely with other students - perhaps in a small group throughout the week - but this was difficult for the reasons above and because it seemed that, as soon as the project was assigned, the more advanced students immediately began working on more advanced problems than i could understand. So it was hard to keep up and feel like i was able to contribute anything worthwhile to a group coding effort.

The main takeaway from this project, for me, is that i need to learn more! I think i have a lot of study to do on my own just to get up to a basic level that most of the class has already surpassed. In addition to that, i think i need to get a better understanding of how to approach a project like this. I need to spend more time up front, planning and mapping what pieces need to be worked on and how they should be accomplished. I underestimated how important that was this week and, instead, got caught up with the attitude of diving right in without really knowing what to do.

Although this project was mostly a fail for me, i do feel like i learned a lot that will offer me a more solid foundation going further. So i will continue to study basic ruby concepts outside class until they are very familiar and easy to implement. Next time, i will ask a lot more questions up front and make a point of relying on my classmates and teachers more.
