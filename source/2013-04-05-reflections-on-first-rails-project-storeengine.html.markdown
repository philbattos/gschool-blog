This week was devoted to finishing and presenting our first Rails project: StoreEngine. Unfortunately, it was not a great experience for me. For most of this project i felt lost in the complexity and new terminology of Rails. I felt like there were so many fundamental ideas that i needed to learn and that the time constraints of the project did not enable me to learn them. So i spent much of this week feeling dumb in class and then trying to study what i needed to outside of class.

In addition to feeling like much of the class time this week was a waste of time for me, i felt like i wasn't able to contribute much to my team's project and thereby put more of a burden on my teammates to complete the work. Since our team was already small (three members instead of four), i think my teammates had an unusually large workload. However, i think if i had continued to put all of my time into the project, i would have slowed down the team's progress and retarded my own understanding.

Outside of class, i feel like i developed a much better, although still basic, understanding of Rails. I worked through five chapters of Hartl's Rails tutorial, started the Contact Manager tutorial, and started a primitive Rails site from scratch. I also worked on several Ruby exercises during the week, including TestFirst exercises, warmups, Ruby Koans, and practicing testing with rspec. I feel like my understanding of Ruby has solidified in the last couple weeks and i feel much more comfortable with it. Also, i think this was the first week that i completed a warmup during the warmup time in the morning - and i did it at least twice (the trinary and grade school warmups).

So i feel pretty good about my progress in the course so far, despite being a few weeks behind most of the class. However, i feel some pressure to learn Rails quickly to be prepared for the next assessment, which will happen in two weeks.
