This week has been a good week. Our team finished our FeedEngine project - kreepr.com - and the review and demo went really well. I think we were all happy with the end product, notwithstanding some reservations about how it could have been done better. I feel like i was able to contribute more to this projects than most of the previous ones. I worked mostly on the front-end but it was satisfying to see some of my work help the group.

I'm really looking forward to the independent project starting next week. There is still so much i need to learn and i think this project will give me a chance to focus on the gaps in my understanding. Writing an app and a gem that consumes an API feels daunting right now but i feel like i have a project idea with the right scope and level of difficulty.

I want to make something that relates to the Forrest Fenn treasure hunt that i have been following: either an app that i can use to research the treasure or a tool that other people might find useful. For now, i think i will start with an app that takes clues or keywords, finds places in Colorado related to those clues in the USGS geonames database, and then displays those places on a map. I think this will be a good place to start for the first iteration. If and when that is completed, the next iterations could be: connecting places in order based on their order in the clues (to create a possible trail to the treasure), and finding areas that contain all or most of the clues (as likely areas for finding the treasure). The USGS geonames database does not provide an API but there is a similar site (geonames.org) that does. So i will probably use that API for searching place names.
